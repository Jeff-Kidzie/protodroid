<h3>What is Protodroid?</h3>

Protodroid is an Android library for intercept every API request and response on GRPC, inspired by Chucker. This library was built with 100% pure Kotlin, AndroidX based components, and can be used on Android App from API 16 (a.k.a Jelly Bean) until the latest version (now is API 29 a.k.a Android10). 

<h3>Why Protodroid?</h3>

Protodroid was built to help Engineering Team especially QA Team to verify the API request and response from client to server. Protodroid is a library that embedded in client App so there is no (you need to enable notification on your Android device so Protodroid can notify every API calls to you) extra configuration or installation to use this library, and also it can be checked anytime, anywhere.

For Frontend Android Team, you can also check in LogCat Android Studio as this library provide logging for the API calls.
